This is a attendance management web service made as a school project.

The service has two user groups at use, one included but not used.

-Admin users are for user management and they can add students and classes/groups the students belong to.
-Teachers who can mark and check attendance of students.
-The one not in use is student users. I planned that they could have a page to check their attendance and maybe send comments or messages for teachers. This has not been implemented.

Remember to update this when on pc again!
